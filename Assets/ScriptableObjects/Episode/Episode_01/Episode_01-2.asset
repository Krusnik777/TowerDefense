  BriefingText: 'Your Majesty!

    We successfully repelled the previous attack
    of the knights, but the enemy does not give up.

    This time they decided
    to attack from the other side and do it with redoubled force. Among the enemies,
    <color=grey><i>dark and heavy knights</i></color>, who are <color=grey><i>highly
    resistant to physical damage</i></color>, are especially dangerous.!

    We
    just need to <color=green><b>survive a few enemy waves</b></color> to win!'
