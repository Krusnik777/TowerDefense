  BriefingText: 'Your Majesty!

    We were attacked by an unknown party. The borders
    of our state are besieged by knights. We must fight them back!

    Fortunately
    our scouts were able to find out that so far the enemy is attacking with small
    forces, but we are obliged to interrupt their onslaught while it is in its infancy.

    We
    only need to <color=green><b>last a few enemy waves</b></color> to win.'
