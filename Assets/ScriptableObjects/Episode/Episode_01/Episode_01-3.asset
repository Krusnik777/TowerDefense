  BriefingText: "Your Majesty!\r\nAlthough we have already defeated the knights twice,
    they decided to step on the same rake for the third time. They just don\u2019t
    want to stop encroaching on the borders of our state.\r\nHowever, this time the
    enemy is betting everything on this attack. They will throw all their forces
    at us.\r\nWe just need to <color=green><b>hold out for a while</b></color> and
