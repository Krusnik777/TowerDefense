  BriefingText: 'Your Majesty!

    The froggers continue their ferocious attacks.
    Now they are especially daring and attacked an important advanced trading post!

    We
    can''t leave it like that!

    The froggers will try to overwhelm us with numbers,
    but if we <color=green><b>hold out for a while</b></color>, we will definitely
    interrupt their atrocities!'
