  BriefingText: 'Your Majesty!

    The food supplies are safe, but now froggers
    have began to attack settlements and prey on residents.

    We must send support
    to protect your subjects!

    as froggers behave in an unnaturally aggressive manner.

    While the construction
    of defense structures is underway it is necessary to <color=green><b>withstand
    few enemy waves</b></color>.'
