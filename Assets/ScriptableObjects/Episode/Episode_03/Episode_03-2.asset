  BriefingText: "\rYour Majesty!\r\nBefore we had time to rest after the showdown
    with the undead, another necromancer also awakened other undead legions. He was
    also quickly eaten, but the capital is under attack again!\r\nThis time there
    will be more enemies, but we have no choice but to hold back their onslaught!\r\nIf
    we <color=green><b>survive several waves</b></color>, then victory will be in
    our pocket!"
