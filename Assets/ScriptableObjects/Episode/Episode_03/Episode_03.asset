  BriefingText: 'Your Majesty!

    A certain necromancer conducted forbidden research,
    and during his another experiment awakened undead legions. He could not control
    them and fell victim to his own actions, but now the undead are marching on the
    capital!

    We must stop their indomitable march!

    Just remember that
    the undead are <color=grey><i>resistant to physical damage</i></color>.

    To
    thin out their ranks, it is enough to <color=green><b>survive a few enemy waves</b></color>.'
